Angular Dojo
============

This is a monorepo for a dojo presented at Des Moines WebGeeks.

## Packages

Here's a small overview of the things under packages.
Each package has it's own readme for more context on running the project.

* `packages/api`: Rails API to save games and notes.
**During the dojo, this isn't required to have running.**
* `packages/frontend`: The Angular project that's the main focus of the dojo.
* `packages/todo-list`: Working example of the todo project from the presentation.
